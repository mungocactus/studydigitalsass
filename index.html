        <div class="why-text">

            <p>Everyone who joins the course is different, we have students straight from college and those with a bit more life experience coming back to study for a second time. We have students with very little experience of design wanting to learn about a new area and others with backgrounds in Graphic Design, Advertising and Illustration who want to add up to date digital skills to their CV to be able to compete in a modern job market.</p>
            <p>They all have one common goal, to gain the ability to work as professionals in the fast growing Digital Design industry. Our aim is to give everyone the very best opportunity to do this.</p>
            <p>Our staff have real experience in their field and continue to work in the industry, alongside teaching, to keep up to date with current skills and trends within the industry. All course content is developed with the advice of industry professionals, the very people that often employee our graduates.</p>
            <p>We focus heavily on real projects and work placements, to make sure the transition from college to work is a smooth one. Many of our students gain part time work through their placements when on the course. We also have a high rate of our graduates gaining employment directly from the course because employers in the region know we produce graduates taught the skills they need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="what-text">

            <h1>What the course covers</h1>

        <p>After doing a summer internship, I was offered my job 5 months before the course ended. I work on mobile web and app projects and some print projects. I have worked on pitches, live projects for a wide and varied range of clients in many countries. I’m really enjoying it, working in the mobile industry is a very interesting and challenging job and enrolling in the course at Newcastle College has been instrumental in all this.</p>
        <p>Our tutor Libby works in the industry herself and stays up to date with the latest technical developments and trends. The course isn’t stuck in the academical world teaching the same course year after year. She knows her stuff and without sounding too soppy has been a great inspiration to me throughout my time on the course. Going on this course has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, I now have a new career in an area I knew nothing about a couple of years ago. I love my new job and am looking forward to an exciting future in a dynamic, young company in an expanding industry.</p>

        <p>In my job I oversee the whole site and get to fine tune the details, get to know the website and customers inside out, and make the site the best it can be; as well as helping to come up with crazy marketing campaigns, creating graphics, writing code and help drive sales. I've worked for agencies too since leaving the course, which were manic and fun, never a dull moment.</p>
        <p>I chose this course because I was able to explore my creativity, learn to code, understand how to get the most out of designing for the web, and work on mobile sites and apps too. I was able to learn the latest skills needed for modern web design, something that no other course offered, at a competitive price.</p>
        <p>While on the course, I was encouraged to do placements and freelance work, and this combined with the modern teaching standards meant I had a great understanding of the web industry.</p>

        <p>Two years ago I was a designer/art director with no experience of web design or any sort of coding. I had only worked in print and advertising and needed to update my skills. I knew nothing of HTML, CSS or any other coding languages, I’d never designed a website, app or anything so I started from scratch. I chose this course because it's geared up for industry, it has great contacts within the digital design community and has a track record of sustained success with many students working in the North East and further afield. There are loads of great opportunities available from his course and over half of my year were working in industry before the course ended.</p>

        <p>In our employees we primarily look for passion, aptitude, understanding of real world roles, and finally skills (in that order). We felt that all students who came through the Digital Design course had 2 key capabilities any small employer looks for.</p>
        <p>They had an extreme amount of passion for digital and they had (surprisingly) a solid understanding how things work in a commercial/business world rather than academic world.</p>

        <p>The Digital Design Course teaches reality. Not a ten year old idea of digital design, but a fully up-to-date, well-informed programme of learning that gives students realistic expectations of the industry they’re entering.</p>
        <p>This means that the students leaving this course are not only well-trained in technical skills, but are level-headed, confident people who are eager to take on the demands of a role in a busy company. No-brainer for us really.</p>
